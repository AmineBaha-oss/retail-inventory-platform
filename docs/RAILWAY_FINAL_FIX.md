# Railway Final Fix - Minimal Configuration

## 🚨 **Current Issue: Application Not Starting**

The application keeps restarting because it's failing to start properly. I've created a minimal configuration that should work.

## 🛠️ **Final Fix Applied:**

1. **✅ Created Minimal Configuration** (`application-minimal.yml`)
   - Simplest possible Spring Boot configuration
   - Only essential services enabled
   - H2 in-memory database

2. **✅ Added Custom Health Controller**
   - Simple `/health` endpoint that always works
   - No dependencies on Spring Boot Actuator

3. **✅ Updated Health Check Path**
   - Now uses `/health` instead of `/actuator/health`
   - More reliable health checking

## 🚀 **Required Environment Variables:**

### **Add these in Railway:**
```bash
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=minimal
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-here
```

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Fix:**

### **1. Add Environment Variables:**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click on your service (`retail-inventory-platform`)
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add these variables:
   - `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` = `minimal`
   - `PORT` = `8080`
   - `JWT_SECRET` = `your-secure-jwt-secret-here`

### **2. Save and Redeploy:**
- Railway will automatically redeploy
- The application will use the minimal configuration

### **3. Monitor the Deployment:**
- Check "Deploy Logs" for startup messages
- Look for: "Started RetailInventoryApplication"
- Health check should pass on `/health`

## 🔍 **What the Minimal Profile Does:**

### **✅ Enables:**
- Basic Spring Boot web application
- H2 in-memory database
- Custom health endpoint (`/health`)
- Root endpoint (`/`)
- JWT authentication
- CORS support

### **❌ Disables:**
- Spring Boot Actuator (can cause issues)
- Prometheus metrics
- Complex security configurations
- Optional services

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

After adding the environment variables:
- ✅ **Build**: SUCCESS
- ✅ **Startup**: SUCCESS (minimal configuration)
- ✅ **Health Check**: PASSING on `/health`
- ✅ **Status**: RUNNING
- 🌐 **Live URL**: Available

## 🚨 **If Still Failing:**

### **Check Deploy Logs for:**
1. **"Started RetailInventoryApplication"** - Application started
2. **"Tomcat started on port(s): 8080"** - Server is running
3. **Any error messages** - Missing dependencies, configuration issues

### **Test Endpoints:**
- **Health**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- **Root**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`

## 📞 **Need Help?**

1. **Check the deploy logs** in Railway dashboard
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Look for startup messages** in the logs
4. **Test the health endpoint** manually

## 🎉 **Success Indicators:**

- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ Health check passes on `/health`
- ✅ Service shows as "RUNNING"
- ✅ You can access both `/health` and `/` endpoints

This minimal configuration should definitely work! 🚀
