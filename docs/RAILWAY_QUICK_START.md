# Railway Quick Start - Fix Deployment Issues

## 🚨 **Current Issue: Application Restarting**

The deployment is building successfully but the application keeps restarting. This is likely due to missing environment variables or database connection issues.

## 🛠️ **Quick Fix: Use Railway Profile**

I've created a special `application-railway.yml` configuration that:
- ✅ Uses H2 in-memory database (no external database needed)
- ✅ Disables problematic services (Redis, Kafka, GraphQL)
- ✅ Simplified configuration for Railway deployment
- ✅ Always shows health check details

## 🚀 **Required Environment Variables**

### **Minimum Required (Add these in Railway):**
```bash
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=railway
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-here
```

### **Optional (for better logging):**
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Fix:**

### **1. Add Environment Variables in Railway:**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click on your service (`retail-inventory-platform`)
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add these variables:
   - `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` = `railway`
   - `PORT` = `8080`
   - `JWT_SECRET` = `your-secure-jwt-secret-here`

### **2. Save and Redeploy:**
- Railway will automatically redeploy with the new configuration
- The application will use the simplified railway profile

### **3. Monitor the Deployment:**
- Check "Deploy Logs" for startup messages
- Look for: "Started RetailInventoryApplication"
- Health check should pass on `/actuator/health`

## 🔍 **What the Railway Profile Does:**

### **✅ Enables:**
- H2 in-memory database (no external database needed)
- Health check endpoint with full details
- Basic web endpoints
- JWT authentication
- CORS support

### **❌ Disables:**
- PostgreSQL database connection
- Redis cache
- Kafka messaging
- GraphQL endpoint
- Prometheus metrics

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

After adding the environment variables:
- ✅ **Build**: SUCCESS
- ✅ **Startup**: SUCCESS (no database connection errors)
- ✅ **Health Check**: PASSING
- ✅ **Status**: RUNNING
- 🌐 **Live URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app`

## 🚨 **If Still Failing:**

### **Check Deploy Logs for:**
1. **"Started RetailInventoryApplication"** - Application started successfully
2. **"Tomcat started on port(s): 8080"** - Server is running
3. **Any error messages** - Database connection, missing dependencies, etc.

### **Common Issues:**
- **Missing JWT_SECRET**: Add the environment variable
- **Port conflicts**: Use `PORT=8080`
- **Database connection**: Railway profile uses H2, no external database needed

## 📞 **Need Help?**

1. **Check the deploy logs** in Railway dashboard
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Look for startup messages** in the logs
4. **Test the health endpoint**: `https://your-app.railway.app/actuator/health`

## 🎉 **Success Indicators:**

- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ Health check passes
- ✅ Service shows as "RUNNING"
- ✅ You can access the health endpoint

Your deployment should work now with the simplified railway profile! 🚀
