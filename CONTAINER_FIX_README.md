# 🛠️ Container Startup Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary

Two Docker containers (`retail_inventory_db` and `retail_inventory_spring_api`) were failing to start due to database initialization script conflicts.

## Root Cause

- Multiple SQL files in `database/init/` directory were trying to INSERT data before schema creation
- PostgreSQL Docker initialization runs SQL files **before** Spring Boot can create the schema
- This caused "relation does not exist" errors, preventing database startup
- Spring API couldn't connect to the failed database

## Solution Applied

1. **Cleaned up database init directory**: Disabled all problematic SQL files that run before schema creation
2. **Fixed startup order**: Database → Spring API (creates schema) → Manual data loading
3. **Created manual data loading scripts**: Load test data after containers are fully operational

## Files Modified

- Disabled: `02-sample-data.sql` and other conflicting init scripts
- Renamed: `03-enhanced-test-data.sql` → `03-enhanced-test-data.sql.manual`
- Created: `load-test-data.bat` (Windows) and `load-test-data.sh` (Linux/Mac)

## Current Working Process

```bash
# 1. Start containers
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Load test data (Windows)
load-test-data.bat

# OR (Linux/Mac)
./load-test-data.sh
```

## Verification

✅ All 7 containers running successfully  
✅ Database schema created by Spring Boot  
✅ Enhanced test data loads correctly  
✅ API endpoints functional  
✅ Frontend accessible

## Data Persistence

- ✅ Enhanced test data persists during normal container operations
- ⚠️ Data resets on `docker-compose down -v` (volumes removed)
- 🔄 Use `load-test-data.bat` to reload data after volume reset

## Container Status

```
✅ retail_inventory_db           - PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB
✅ retail_inventory_spring_api   - Spring Boot API (healthy)
✅ retail_inventory_frontend     - React frontend
✅ retail_inventory_ml_api       - Python ML API
✅ retail_inventory_redis        - Redis cache
✅ retail_inventory_grafana      - Grafana dashboards
✅ retail_inventory_prometheus   - Prometheus monitoring
```

## Next Steps

The system is now fully operational with realistic SaaS test data including:

- 7 stores across major US cities
- 6 suppliers (premium, designer, casual, accessories, sustainable)
- 14 products with realistic pricing and descriptions
- 19 inventory records with business scenarios
- 6 purchase orders in various stages

All backend features work correctly:

- Auto-generated PO numbers and SKUs
- Brand inheritance from suppliers
- Store product counts
- Active/inactive status toggles
- Complete CRUD operations
